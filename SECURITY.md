   - Potential impact and any suggested mitigation.

3. **Expectations:** We'll acknowledge your email within a reasonable timeframe, and we'll keep you updated on our progress.

4. **Disclosure:** Once the vulnerability is confirmed and resolved, we'll coordinate with you to determine the appropriate timeline for disclosure.
